          <h2>4. How we use your personal data</h2>

          <h3>Legal basis</h3>
          <p>The law requires us to have a legal basis for collecting and using your personal data. We rely on one or more of the following legal bases:</p>

          <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: var(--space-lg); line-height: var(--leading-relaxed); margin-top: var(--space-md);">
            <li><strong>Performance of a contract with you:</strong> Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> We may use your personal data where it is necessary to conduct our business and pursue our legitimate interests, for example to prevent fraud and enable us to give you the best and most secure customer experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal obligation:</strong> We may use your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.</li>

          <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: var(--space-lg); line-height: var(--leading-relaxed); margin-top: var(--space-md);">

          </ul>

          <p class="mt-md">We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>

        <!-- Section 6 -->
        <div id="section-6" class="mt-2xl">
          <h2>6. International transfers</h2>

          <p>We may transfer your personal data to service providers that carry out certain functions on our behalf. This may involve transferring personal data outside the EU/EEA to countries which have laws that do not provide the same level of data protection as EU law.</p>

          <p class="mt-md">Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EU/EEA to service providers, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring that the following safeguards are in place: We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed by the EU to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data; or where we use service providers based in countries without adequacy decisions, we use standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 7 -->
        <div id="section-7" class="mt-2xl">
          <h2>7. Data security</h2>

          <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>

          <p class="mt-md">We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 8 -->
        <div id="section-8" class="mt-2xl">
          <h2>8. Data retention</h2>

          <h3>How long will you use my personal data for?</h3>
          <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.</p>

          <p class="mt-md">To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.</p>

          <p class="mt-md">By law we have to keep basic information about our clients (including Contact, Identity and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being clients for tax purposes in accordance with Revenue requirements in Ireland.</p>

          <p class="mt-md">In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see paragraph 9 below for further information.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 9 -->
        <div id="section-9" class="mt-2xl">
          <h2>9. Your legal rights</h2>

          <p>You have a number of rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. You have the right to:</p>

          <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: var(--space-lg); line-height: var(--leading-relaxed); margin-top: var(--space-md);">
            <li><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a "subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
            <li><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
            <li><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data in certain circumstances. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.</li>
            <li><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest as the legal basis for that particular use of your data.</li>
            <li><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.</li>
            <li><strong>Withdraw consent</strong> at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.</li>
            <li><strong>Request restriction</strong> of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in certain scenarios.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="mt-md">If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us using the details in section 10.</p>

          <h3 class="mt-lg">No fee usually required</h3>
          <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>

          <h3 class="mt-lg">What we may need from you</h3>
          <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.</p>

          <h3 class="mt-lg">Time limit to respond</h3>
          <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
