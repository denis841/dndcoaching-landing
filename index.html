        <p class="opening-hook">You're doing everything right... so why aren't you seeing results?</p>

        <div class="pain-point">
          <p>You train 3-5 times a week. You've tried every program, every split, every "proven system" you found online. You're putting in the work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="pain-point">
          <p>But your progress stopped months ago. The scale won't budge. Your lifts plateaued. Your physique looks exactly the same as it did 6 months ago, despite consistent training.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="pain-point">
          <p>You're stuck in an endless loop: get motivated, train hard for 4-6 weeks, see minimal results, lose motivation, repeat. Meanwhile, you see other people transforming their bodies and think "what am I doing wrong?"</p>
        </div>

        <p class="real-problem">Here's the truth: It's not your fault. You don't lack discipline or willpower. You lack direction.</p>

        <p>Every day you stay on this path is another day of wasted effort. Another week of feeling frustrated in the mirror. Another month wondering if you'll ever actually achieve the physique you're capable of.</p>

        <p class="fear">What if you look back a year from now and you're still exactly where you are today—still stuck, still confused, still wishing you had just found the right guidance?</p>

        <h2>I've Been Exactly Where You Are</h2>
        <p>I'm Denis. I've been training for 8 years, and I've lived the exact struggle you're facing right now.</p>
        <p>I wasted years jumping from program to program, trying every diet trend, reading endless conflicting advice online. I trained consistently but saw inconsistent results. I felt stuck, frustrated, and confused.</p>
        <p>It took me 8 years to figure out what actually works. The secret? It's not about more information—it's about the RIGHT information applied to YOUR specific situation.</p>

        <div class="method">
          <h3>The Diagnosis-First Approach</h3>
          <p>Most programs give you a generic plan and hope it works. I do the opposite.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Understand your specific blockers (why past attempts failed)</li>
            <li>Remove what doesn't work (simplify, eliminate variables)</li>
            <li>Build sustainable habits (standards, not motivation)</li>
            <li>Track and adjust weekly (accountability without micromanagement)</li>

        <p>We're not trying to scale to 100 clients. We're focused on delivering real, lasting transformations for a small group of committed individuals.</p>
        <p><strong>Here's why:</strong> We've both lived every struggle you're facing — years of training, plateaus, failed programs. We're currently coaching 5 clients through the exact system we built and tested on ourselves. This isn't a mass-produced program — it's hands-on, personalised guidance.</p>
        <p><strong>What makes this work:</strong> We diagnose YOUR specific blockers (why past attempts failed), remove what doesn't work, and build sustainable habits. It's structured, but it's tailored.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How is this different from free programs online?</h3>
          <p>Free programs are generic templates. This is customized diagnosis: I identify YOUR specific blockers, remove what doesn't work for YOU, and adjust weekly based on YOUR results. Plus, you have direct access to me for accountability and real-time adjustments.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>I've tried coaching before and it didn't work. Why will this be different?</h3>
          <p>Most coaches sell you a program and hope it works. I diagnose first—we figure out exactly why past attempts failed before prescribing anything. Plus, this isn't a "set it and forget it" program. We're working together weekly to troubleshoot and optimize.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Do I have to meal prep and eat chicken and broccoli every day?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely not. You'll track macros (calories and protein primarily), but you choose what foods fit those targets. Want pizza on Saturday? Budget for it. Flexible nutrition, not food prison.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What if I miss a workout or mess up my diet one day?</h3>
          <p>Life happens. The goal is 90% compliance—that means you can have "off" days. We track weekly averages, not daily perfection. One bad day doesn't ruin progress if the system is solid.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What happens after 12 weeks?</h3>
          <p>You'll have the knowledge and habits to maintain results independently. If you want continued coaching, there's an option to stay on at €30/week. But the goal is for you to not need me forever.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How much time does this require per week?</h3>
          <p>Training: 3-5 hours (your current schedule). Tracking nutrition: 5-10 minutes per day. Check-ins: 5 minutes on Sundays. Coaching calls: 25 minutes weekly. Total additional time: ~1 hour per week for tracking and calls.</p>
